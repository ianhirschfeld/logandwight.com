In my time as Director of Product, I led the expansion and re-focusing of the company's core applications to provide high-demand features to <i>Littlstar's</i> core user base. This involved expanded 360 media player support, as well as support for additional formats such as legacy video and augmented reality assets. <br><br>Additionally, I led product direction on <i>Ara</i>, a new decentralized media distribution technology that was spun off to support the company's core business. Development of <i>Ara</i> consisted of a new blockchain protocol, peer-to-peer file sharing infrastructure, and decentralized file management application for end-users. I worked closely with principle leads across the engineering & business development teams to define the rules of the network, anticipate common use-cases based on user feedback, and design & plan the development of key supporting applications for the product's launch. <i>Ara</i> launched on the <i>Ethereum</i> network at the end of 2018.",

Our team’s goal was to create a narrative-based adventure focused on meaningful interactivity, exploration, and thrilling vehicle travel. We knew from the beginning that we didn’t want the entire experience to take place “on foot”, so we centered our design around a single setpiece vehicle - the hoverbike. From there, we crafted our universe to support a story that takes place over great distances, taking users from one major location to another across a vast wasteland. To introduce people to this world, we created a short “prologue” demo where users explore a desert environment, ride the hover-bike, and solve a series of interactive puzzles.",
